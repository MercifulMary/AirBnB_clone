0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integratio
 Store first object
mandatory
Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation:

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
It’s great but it’s still not persistent: every time you launch the program, you don’t restore all objects created before… The first way you will see here is to save these objects to a file.

Writing the dictionary representation to a file won’t be relevant:

Python doesn’t know how to convert a string to a dictionary (easily)
It’s not human readable
Using this file with another program in Python or other language will be hard.
So, you will convert the dictionary representation to a JSON string. JSON is a standard representation of a data structure. With this format, humans can read and all programming languages have a JSON reader and writer.

Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow those actions: show, create, destroy, update and all with all classes created previously.

Enjoy your first console!

No unittests needed for the console
